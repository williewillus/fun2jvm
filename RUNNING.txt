Please include clear and simple instructions for running your project.

I include a Gradle build script for compiling this project.

To clear: ./gradlew clean
To build a jar in build/libs: ./gradlew build
To run the compiler (outputs a .class in the same directory as .fun): 
    java -jar build/libs/fun2jvm.jar <path-to-fun-file>
To run all detected tests: ./gradlew test

Simply executing ./gradlew will run clean, build, and test in that order.

Explain why your supplied tests illustrate that your project works
The 16 tests provided alongside p5 are reused for this project. The goal is 
that the output is the same as that produced by p5. That is, the output is 
that same as the .ok file of the same name. I achieve that goal in this project.

Extra .fun and .ok can be placed in the root directory and will be picked up
by the test code. .fun's without .ok files will not be run.
I'd be interested in seeing how my project fares on the hidden p5 tests, I'm fairly
certain that it will pass the rest, but I want to know if it doesn't.
